# TupleHash

If someone wants the value for "cat", I'll just walk through until I find an array with that key, then return the value - in this case, 'gato'. Writing is the same except I either change the value or insert a new tuple.

# Rate of growth

Wave O(1), handshakes O(N), introductions O(N**2)

As your algorithm is given bigger problems to solve, how much more work does it have to do? For example, if I double the inputs, does it take you twice as much work? More than twice as much? Just one more step?

# Orders of growth

Traveling salesman O(N factorial) - if 5 cities 0.12 seconds, 21 is 97 billion years

In the long run, any O(1) beats any O(N) beats any O(N**2)
